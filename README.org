** What is it?

This is a script that takes a .FIT file from Garmin and converts into a human readable .csv. 

** How to

First things first - get a .FIT file. You set this by going to Garmin connect, your activities and selecting an activity - [[https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities][here]]. Click on an activity and then on the little cog. It's best to do this on a full desktop/laptop. The mobile website does not give you these options.Click ~Export Original~  and this will download a zip file with your activity .FIT file.

You will also need to install FitParse:

#+begin_src bash
  pip install fitparse
#+end_src

If you extract you .FIT file to a folder and rename as ~activity.fit~ and place the ~parser.py~ script in that same folder. Open a terminal and run with the following command

#+begin_src bash
python script.py
#+end_src

You will now have a .csv file called ~output.csv~ which contains all your data as well as a column with elapsed time. Now, you can use this to plot however you like!

You can then plot however you like. 

** Example Plot
Running ~plotting.py~ gives you the below plot.

** What is it?

This is a script that takes a .FIT file from Garmin and converts into a human readable .csv. 

** How to

First things first - get a .FIT file. You set this by going to Garmin connect, your activities and selecting an activity - [[https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities][here]]. Click on an activity and then on the little cog. It's best to do this on a full desktop/laptop. The mobile website does not give you these options.Click ~Export Original~  and this will download a zip file with your activity .FIT file.

You will also need to install FitParse:

#+begin_src bash
  pip install fitparse
#+end_src

If you extract you .FIT file to a folder and rename as ~activity.fit~ and place the ~parser.py~ script in that same folder. Open a terminal and run with the following command

#+begin_src bash
python script.py
#+end_src

You will now have a .csv file called ~output.csv~ which contains all your data as well as a column with elapsed time. Now, you can use this to plot however you like!

You can then plot however you like. 

** Example Plot
#+begin_src python :results output
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
    
df = pd.read_csv('./output.csv')
    
    
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
    
ax1.set_xlabel('Time (min)')

ax1.set_ylabel('Heart Rate (bpm)', color='tab:red')

ax1.plot(df['Elapsed Time (s)']/60,df['heart_rate (bpm)'], color = 'tab:red')

ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='tab:red')
    


ax2 = ax1.twinx()
    

ax2.plot(df['Elapsed Time (s)']/60,df['enhanced_speed (m/s)'],color='tab:blue')



ax2.set_ylabel('Speed (m/s)', color='tab:blue')

ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='tab:blue')
  

#plt.show()

plt.savefig('plot.png', dpi=1200)
    
    
    
    
    
    
#+end_src
